Ignis components have a lifecycle that is different to that of a Razor component. This is done to allow for more control
over the rendering process.

The following flowchart shows the lifecycle of the default component in Ignis. You can adopt this lifecycle for your own
component by inheriting from `IgnisComponentBase`. There is also an `IgnisAsyncComponentBase` that you can inherit from
if you need to perform asynchronous operations in your component.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A([SetParametersAsync]) --> B{First Call?}
    B -->|Yes| C[OnInitialized]
    C --> D[OnUpdate]
    B -->|No| D
    D --> E([Update])
    E --> F[Render]
```

You **should** always call the `Update` method when you want to update the component outside of this lifecycle. This
will trigger a re-render of the component.

You can read more about when parameters are
set [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/lifecycle?view=aspnetcore-7.0#when-parameters-are-set-setparametersasync).

## Rigid components

Rigid components are components that only render when parameters are changed. You can make your component rigid by
inheriting from `IgnisRigidComponentBase`.

```csharp
public class MyComponent : IgnisRigidComponentBase
{
    [Parameter]
    public string MyParameter { get; set; }

    protected override void OnRender()
    {
        // This will be called when the component is first rendered and when MyParameter is changed.
    }
}
```

## Additional lifecycle methods

Contrary to Razor components, Ignis components do not offer an `OnAfterRender` method, nor do they automatically update
on event callbacks.

You can still add this functionality to your component by implementing the `IHandleAfterRender` interface or
the `IHandleEvent` interface.

```csharp
public class MyComponent : IgnisComponentBase, IHandleAfterRender, IHandleEvent
{
    public Task OnAfterRenderAsync()
    {
        // This will be called after the component has been rendered.
    }

    public Task HandleEventAsync(EventCallbackWorkItem item, object? arg)
    {
        // This will be called when an event is triggered.
    }
}
```

## `ServerPrerendered` rendering mode

Also contrary to Razor components, Ignis component's lifecycle methods are not called twice when the rendering mode is
set to `ServerPrerendered`.

If you still want to have the same behaviour as Razor components, you can either inherit from
the `IgnisRigidComponentBase` class or implement the `IHandleAfterRender` interface.
